## This website

My goal with this website is to create a place where potential employers can go and hopefully get a good user experience as they navigate through my background and skills. An added benefit is that along the way I was able to practice website development skills. I will continually add to and update this website to enhance the user experience as much as possible by optimising aesthetics and formating the most comprehensive content possible.

## My goals

My goals are to:

1. never stop learning 
2. use my knowledge to create more and consume less
3. create solutions to world problems and advance society through technology

                                I graduated with a Master of Science degree from the Microelectronics-Photonics 
                                program from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, in the spring of 2016. My thesis
                                was titled "<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a64d/9f7109d54835be274bd07423558d835d6d50.pdf">Investigation of optical properties of zinc oxide photodetector</a>" and my advisor
                                was Prof. Ryan Tian. My final GPA was a 3.8.

                                    This engineering program is an interdisciplinary graduate school which takes students from
                                    electrical engineering, physics, and materials science/chemistry. The program focuses on 
                                    semiconductor device physics & manufacturing, electrical engineering, as well as on business administration and 
                                    management setting the students up for leadership positions and even entrepreneurship. Engineering coursework examples:

                              I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry with a concentration in Biochemistry from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville
                            in the spring of 2014. This degree equipped me with the principles and foundations of 
                            materials science and biology that allows me to thrive in biotechnology/bioinformatics. Due to the amount of mathematics courses that I 
                            took, I was qualified for a math minor. Science coursework examples:

                                    Engineering is applied science, but great engineering is rooted in  
                                    understanding the underlying principles of physics, creativity, and hard work. Most of the competence with engineering comes from the experience of 
                                    creating and interacting with the real world to see how objects respond to forces acted upon them. This 
                                    real world experience of building things, fixing things, and working with your hands is what allows for a 
                                    better understanding of the theory when taking engineering courses.

                                During my graduate school work in the <a href="https://microelectronics-photonics.uark.edu/">MicroEP</a> program I was able to 
                                work as a teaching assistant in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at the <a href="https://www.uark.edu/">U of A</a>.
                                My work included:
                                <br>
                               <br> - taught labs for Chemistry I, II, Chemistry II for engineers, Honors Chemistry II, and Fundamentals of Chemistry.

                               When not pursuing an education or a career in STEM I have had no problem getting labor
                               intensive jobs such as at Marion County Paving where my roles included:
                               <br>
                               <br> -	Placed in charge of GPS survey equipment and helped improve construction site surveying and planning. 
                              <br> -	Assisted paving and concrete crew with all forms of labor. Operate heavy machinery and work with hand tools and power tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have also used the skills I gained from my biomechanics certifications
                                to do personal training on the side in the form of physical therapy. This along with contracting myself out to do various farm work such as building fences and tree work has 
                                taught me that work ethic is a major component for success and even being creative.

                        Every job that I have had I have proved myself to be an integral part of the team where I have been strongly encouraged to 
                        return anytime. While working very hard to develop my emotional intellegince and communication skills with each team I was able
                        to make valuable long lasting connections. Please contact me by phone or email to get a full list of references.

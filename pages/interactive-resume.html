                                I graduated with a Master of Science degree from the Microelectronics-Photonics 
                                program from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, in the spring of 2016. My thesis
                                was titled "<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a64d/9f7109d54835be274bd07423558d835d6d50.pdf">Investigation of optical properties of zinc oxide photodetector</a>" and my advisor
                                was Prof. Ryan Tian. My final GPA was a 3.8.

                              I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville
                            in the spring of 2014. This degree equipped me with the principles and foundations of 
                            materials science and biology that allows me to thrive in biotechnology/bioinformatics. Due to the amount of mathematics courses that I 
                            took, I was qualified for a math minor. Science coursework examples:

                              I am very passionate about learning which has led me to pursue multiple
                            resources online and in person to broaden my skillset. I am currently taking a 
                            machine learning course online which has me working on multiple machine learning 
                            projects. I am also taking multiple online courses in data science and computer
                            programming so that I can more easily create machine learning applications. Please 
                            jump over to my <a href="https://github.com/tylerchism">GitHub</a> and check out some of
                            my recent projects. Languages I am most familiar with: C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, & CSS.

                                I currently have two Biomechanics certifications, and I continue to study biohacking through
                                books and podcasts. Bioinformatics is one of my favorite areas of research and I hope,
                                to break into the field by combining my biology/chemistry expertise with my data science and 
                                machine learning knowledge.

                                    Any work or research I do outside of my career studies is focused on the latest
                                    biotechnology research. A biochemistry background
                                    allows me to study these issues with a deep undertanding of underlying mechanisms. I learn about these technologies through podcasts and books.
                                    Areas of interest include: bioinformatics, genetics testing, neurophysiology, endocrinology,
                                    electrophysiology, enzymology, immunology, kinesiology, pathology, etc.  My ultimate goal is to
                                    combine the interest of biotechnology with machine learning through the creation of 
                                    useful applications that can benefit the world.

                                    Engineering is applied science, but great engineering is rooted in  
                                    understanding the underlying principles of physics, creativity, and hard work. Most of the competence with engineering comes from the experience of 
                                    creating and interacting with the real world to see how objects respond to forces acted upon them. This 
                                    real world experience of building things, fixing things, and working with your hands is what allows for a 
                                    better understanding of the theory when taking engineering courses.

                                   Through my computer programming/CS learning journey I have become versed in C++, Javascript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and general 
                                   data structure and algorithm theory.
                                    I'm working very hard to develop a solid framework and understanding of machine learning systems at a fundemental level so 
                                   that I can utilize the underlying math and computer science theory to build useful applications 
                                   to serve the world.

                               When not pursuing education and career in STEM I have had no problem getting labor
                               intensive jobs as I value hard work. such as at Marion County Paving where my roles included:

                               <br> -	Placed in charge of GPS survey equipment and helped improve construction site surveying and planning.

                                to do personal training on the side in the form of physical therapy. This along with contracting myself out to do various farm work such as building fences and tree work has 
                                taught me that work ethic is a major component for success and even being creative.

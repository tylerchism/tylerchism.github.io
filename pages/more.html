            <p>
               
                Over the past few months I have taken a deep dive into the world of 
                machine learning. Since computer programming wasnâ€™t heavily covered 
                in my coursework I have engaged in a multitude of online courses and
                 self-study projects to be able to increase my skillset in the field
                  and ultimately to pursue a career in the realm of data science. Machine learning
                   and AI have become my favorite area of research 
                  and as such I have taken up some projects to help me better learn ML 
                  and to come up with novel applications that can benefit the world. Lately I have 
                  been generating machine learnign algorithms from scratch and comparing them to Scikit-learn
                  algorithms using large data from various datasets. I am covering linear regression, k-nearest neighbors,
                  support vector machines, and neural networks with TensorFlow. 
                  
                </p>
                <p> I have also built two simple web applications that deal with image 
                  classification using TensorFlow.js and transfer learning. You can see this first one <a href="project1/index.html">here</a>  has been modified to take in webcam feed 
                instead of uploading images. And the second one <a href="project2/index.html">here</a>  which modifies
                it even further to use the model to classify up to three images
                yourself (whatever you hold in front of the webcam) by clicking one
                of the three buttons. Then when you hold the object back in
                front of the webcam it will tell you the likelyhood that the object
                is one of the three items (A, B, or C).
                </p>
               <p>
                My goal is to try to do a simple ML project each week along with 
                continuing to work on coding challenges. Feel free to check out 
                my <a href="https://github.com/tylerchism">GitHub profile</a>  to see my most recent work.

             <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="about">
                I am constantly in pursuit of knowledge. I'm happy as long as
                as I never stop learning. My second most notable feature is that
                I'm diligent about getting to the root of issues and doing things
                the right way. I don't consider myself to fully master A concept 
                until I grasp the underlying principle of it. This has led me
                to excel in a wide range of STEM subjects without having to 
                limit myself to one narrow field.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal in life is to be a producer instead of a consumer. I
                want to use my STEM field knowledge to create solutions and deliver
                these solutions to the world so as to advance society as much
                as possible. I know that a strong work ethic along with an advanced
                skillset will go a long way, but communication and teamwork are a 
                very vital component to being successful and contributing to society.
                For this reason, I not only engage in self-study for science related
                disciplines, but also for being a better communicator and colleague.

            <img src="../images/lakesunset.jpg" alt="lake sunset">
            <p id="home">When I'm not working on projects or researching the
                latest biotechnology & science news then I enjoy listening to podcasts and reading in the
                areas of, you guessed it...biotechnology and the latest science news. My health, both mental
                and physical, is my number one priority so I work hard to stay active
                as much as possible.
                When I'm not working out or reading or studying online then I
                spend most of the time outside usually in the woods. Any 
                chance I get I'm out hunting public lands either in the
                Ozark mountains where I grew up, or out west with my sister
                in Idaho.

                idea of my reading interests and book recomendations. And don't
                forget to check back in here as I'll be adding more features and 
                functionality to keep you up to date on my projects which should get
                pretty interesting.

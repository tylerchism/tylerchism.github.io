            <h3>GUI for AR Data Collection (04/2021 - Present)</h3>
            <p>
                 
                Created GUI for data collection at magic leap. GUI interfaced with motion tracking software as well as AR device API to assist users in collecting data with the device and managing meta data and uploading to the cloud. 
                
            </p>
            <p> 
                Used OOP in python along with Kivy framework to create the multi- platform application.
            </p>

            <h3>Rapid Prototyping for Robotic Collection (08/2020 - 08/2020) </h3>
            <p>
             
                Used Arduino servo with 80/20 bar and pulley components to quickly build a robotic track system for special image capture data collection request.            
            </p>
            <p> 
                Created script using python and Arduino to automate collection with track setup.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Conversion Pipeline (11/2020 - Present) </h3>
            <p>
             
                Develop and maintain Dockerfile and python scripts for a data post- processing job that runs on the cloud as a runtime job.            
            </p>
            <p> 
                Conversion job uses Ubuntu image along with OOP python scripts to convert raw data from AR device sensors as well as motion capture cameras into data format that is consumed by computer vision customers.
            </p>

            <h3>Automate Point Cloud Rendering (09/2020 - 10/2020)</h3>
            <p>
             
                Use open source point cloud renderer Potree along with nodejs, npm, and docker to make a dockerized Ubuntu that converts native point cloud data from lidar into a format that Potree can use.            
            </p>
            <p> 
                Docker image will automatically convert files then create webpage that can be viewed locally on a web browser using the Potree application.
            </p>

            <h3>Multiple Ground Truth Mapping (05/2021 - Present)</h3>
            <p>
             
                Use total station and survey equipment to provide third layer of ground truth data to spatial computing device            
            </p>
            <p> 
                Make CAD designs and use hardware and tools to manufacture targets that can tie together motion capture ground truth tracking data with Lidar and total station ground truth sources.            </p>
            </p>

            <h3>Zinc Oxide Photo-Detector (Thesis Work)</h3>
            <p>
             
                Used physical vapor deposition, soldering, hydrothermal nano-synthesis, and custom photo-detection experimental setup to collect and analyze data for thesis work on the optical properties of zinc oxide nanostructures.            
            </p>
            <p> 
                The resulting thesis can be found <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a64d/9f7109d54835be274bd07423558d835d6d50.pdf">here</a>. Unfortunately, my knowledge of optics was not advanced enough during this work to further the work and reach any meaningful conclusions although the data and underlying findings are still valuable.            </p>

             <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="about">
                I am constantly in pursuit of knowledge. I'm happy as long as
                as I never stop learning. My second most notable feature is that
                I'm diligent about getting to the root of issues and doing things
                the right way. I don't consider myself a master A concept 
                until I grasp the underlying principle of it. This has led me
                to excel in a wide range of STEM subjects without having to 
                limit myself to one narrow field.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal in life is to be a producer instead of a consumer. I
                want to use my STEM field knowledge to create solutions and deliver
                these solutions to the world so as to advance society as much
                as possible. I know that a strong work ethic along with an advanced
                skillset will go a long way, but communication and teamwork are a 
                very vital component to being successful and contributing to society.
                For this reason, I not only engage in self-study for science related
                disciplines but also for being a better communicator and colleague.

            <img src="../images/lakesunset.jpg" alt="lake sunset">
            <p id="home">
                I'm very enthusiastic about spending time with friends and family. Most of my favorite activities lead me outdoors, but occasionally I enjoy staying in to play 
                strategy-based board games.
                I grew up hunting public land and as such have taken a great interest in conservation. So, I spend a lot of time listening to podcasts
                and learning about conservation, the environment, evoltionary biology, history, and other related topics so as to be better educated on 
                ways in which humans can live more sustainably.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also consider health and fitness to be one of my top priorities and so I also spend a great deal of time reading, and listenting to podcasts 
                about nutrition, physical fitness, medicine, and more. This interest also lead me to get a degree in Biochemistry, although now I find that I am much more 
                interested in optics, physics, and other new technologies.
